# Rodrigo Américo

Radiologist physician working in high-complexity healthcare environments, with a strong interest in the practical application of technology to solve real-world problems in radiology and digital health.

This repository aggregates independent technical projects and experiments focused on applied software engineering within the medical domain, including workflow automation, medical imaging processing, and clinical systems integration.

## Project scope

The projects in this repository focus on:
- automation of radiology operational workflows
- processing and structuring of medical imaging and data
- conceptual and technical integration with clinical systems (PACS, RIS, and related platforms)
- practical validation of ideas and proof-of-concept implementations in real environments

All solutions are developed for personal use, in-depth study, and applied experimentation, guided by concrete clinical needs.

## Principles

- emphasis on practical execution and real-world applicability
- technology as a tool to address clinical and operational challenges
- clear separation between independent projects and institutional roles
- clarity, simplicity, and functionality over unnecessary complexity

## Organization

Each individual repository includes its own technical description, documentation, and usage instructions when applicable.

This profile does not represent commercial products or institutional solutions, but rather applied technical capability grounded in healthcare and radiology practice.
