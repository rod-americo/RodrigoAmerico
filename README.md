# Rodrigo Américo

Radiologist physician with extensive experience in high-complexity healthcare environments, focused on the applied use of software engineering to address real-world problems in radiology, medical imaging, and healthcare operations.

This profile consolidates independent, hands-on technical work developed alongside clinical practice, emphasizing execution, system-level thinking, and deep domain integration rather than generic software development.

## Technical focus

My technical work centers on applied software engineering in healthcare, including:

- automation and optimization of radiology workflows
- medical imaging processing and data extraction
- interaction with clinical systems and imaging infrastructure (PACS, RIS, DICOM-based environments)
- design of practical pipelines supporting research, operations, and AI-driven initiatives

The emphasis is on solutions that operate in real clinical contexts, under real constraints, informed by direct medical practice.

## Scope and maturity

Projects in this profile reflect:
- senior-level technical reasoning grounded in domain expertise
- system integration rather than isolated tooling
- practical execution over academic or exploratory prototypes
- long-term maintainability and operational relevance

Several projects and components are maintained in private repositories due to their experimental nature, clinical context, or dependency on non-public data and systems. Public repositories represent selected artifacts and abstractions of broader technical work.

## Positioning

This work does not represent commercial products, consulting offerings, or institutional deliverables.  
It reflects applied technical capability developed independently, informed by years of clinical, operational, and leadership experience in radiology.

The core value lies at the intersection of:
- medical domain expertise
- applied software engineering
- system-level thinking in healthcare environments
